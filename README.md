## Overview
Tokenless Instagram's private API.

This project intends to provide all the features available in the Instagram API including media upload, direct messaging, stories and more.

* Please note that this project is still in design and development phase, the libraries may suffer major changes, so don't rely (yet) in this software for production uses.

* It is being developed in Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10.1 (10B61)

### Integration
To use this library in your project manually you may:

1. compile framework and add it to project
2. for Workspaces, include the whole SwiftyInsta.xcodeproj

## Features

```swift
let handler = try! APIBuilder()
.createBuilder()
.setHttpHandler(config: .default)
.setRequestDelay(delay: .default)
.setUser(user: user)
.build()
```

#### Login
```swift
try? handler.login { (result) in
// result: Result<LoginResultModel>
}
```

#### Logout
```swift
try? handler.logout { (result) in
// result: Result<Bool>
}
```

#### Get User
```swift
try? handler.getUser(username: "username", completion: { (result) in
// result: (Result<UserModel>)
})
```

#### Get Followers
```swift
// searchQuery: search for specific username
// paginationParameter: number of pages to read followers from.
try handler.getUserFollowers(username: "", paginationParameter: PaginationParameters.maxPagesToLoad(maxPages: 15), searchQuery: "", completion: { (result) in
// result: Result<[UserShortModel]>
})
```

## TODO
Currently the library suffers from nested asynchronous functions (Pyramid of Doom), the next step is *Optimizing Library*
- [ ] Writing Cleaner Asynchronous Code Using PromiseÂ Pattern
